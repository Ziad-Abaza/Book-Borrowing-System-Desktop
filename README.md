## Introduction

This project is a **Book Borrowing System** developed as a **college project** to manage library operations efficiently. It is a **desktop application** built using **Java** for the backend logic and **Java Swing** for the user interface. The system integrates with a **MySQL database** to store and manage data related to books, students, and users.

The application provides a comprehensive set of features for librarians to manage books, issue and return books, manage student information, and handle user accounts. It is designed to streamline library operations and improve the overall management process.

   git clone https://github.com/Ziad-Abaza/Book-Borrowing-System-Desktop.git
   ```

2. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Run the provided SQL script (`database.sql`) to create the necessary tables in your MySQL database.
   - Update the `DatabaseConnection` class with your MySQL credentials (URL, username, password).

3. **Import the Project**:
   - Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Locate the `LoginUI` class in the `library.management.system.ui` package.
   - Run the `LoginUI` class to start the application.

5. **Login Credentials**:
   - Use the following default credentials to log in (or create new users via the UI):
     - **User ID**: `admin`

## Database Schema

The database consists of the following tables:

1. **`book` Table**:
   - Stores book details such as name, publisher, price, status, issue date, due date, and student ID (if issued).

2. **`student` Table**:
   - Stores student details such as name, course, branch, and semester.

3. **`login` Table**:
   - Stores user credentials (user ID and password).

### SQL Script

```sql
CREATE TABLE `book` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `publisher` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `price` decimal(10,2) NOT NULL,
  `status` enum('available','issued') DEFAULT 'available',
  `issuedate` date DEFAULT NULL,
  `duedate` date DEFAULT NULL,
  `studentid` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `studentid` (`studentid`),
  CONSTRAINT `book_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`studentid`) REFERENCES `student` (`id`)
);

CREATE TABLE `login` (
  `userid` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `password` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`userid`)
);

CREATE TABLE `student` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `course` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `branch` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `semester` varchar(20) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);
